Sure! Here are some coding practice questions on each of the topics you mentioned:

### 1️⃣ **Introduction to TypeScript**
- **Question 1**: Write a TypeScript program that prints "Hello, TypeScript!" to the console.
- **Question 2**: Define a variable `age` in TypeScript with a number type and set it to any integer. Then, create a function `doubleAge` that takes a number as input and returns the double of the given number.
- **Question 3**: Create a TypeScript program that takes a string as input and prints whether the string is a valid email address using basic TypeScript checks (e.g., includes an "@" symbol).

### 2️⃣ **Basic Types in TypeScript**
- **Question 4**: Define a variable `userName` of type `string` and a variable `userAge` of type `number`. Then, write a function `greetUser` that takes a `string` and a `number` and returns a greeting like "Hello, [name]. You are [age] years old."
- **Question 5**: Define an array of strings and an array of numbers. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.
- **Question 6**: Create an enum called `Color` with values `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`. Then, create a function that takes a `Color` value and returns a message, such as "You selected Red".

### 3️⃣ **Functions and Type Annotations**
- **Question 7**: Write a function `multiply` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of type `number`, and returns their product. Specify the return type of the function as `number`.
- **Question 8**: Create a function `greet` that takes a `name` parameter of type `string` and an optional `age` parameter of type `number`. If `age` is provided, include it in the greeting; if not, just greet the name.
- **Question 9**: Implement function overloading in TypeScript by creating a `sum` function that takes either two numbers or two strings as parameters. If two numbers are passed, it should return their sum; if two strings are passed, it should return their concatenation.
- **Question 10**: Create a function `calculateDiscount` with default parameters. The function should take `price` (number) and `discount` (number, defaulting to 0.1) and return the price after applying the discount.

### 4️⃣ **Interfaces and Type Aliases**
- **Question 11**: Define an interface `Person` with properties `name` (string), `age` (number), and `email` (string). Then, create an object that adheres to the `Person` interface and log it to the console.
- **Question 12**: Extend the `Person` interface from the previous question by adding a property `address` (string). Create a new object that includes this property.
- **Question 13**: Define a type alias `Shape` for a union type that can either be a `Circle` with a `radius` property or a `Rectangle` with `width` and `height` properties. Write a function that takes a `Shape` as input and calculates the area based on its type.
- **Question 14**: Create an interface `Employee` with properties `id` (number), `name` (string), and `role` (string). Use the `Employee` interface in a function that takes an array of employees and prints each employee’s name and role.

These questions should cover a wide range of concepts in TypeScript and provide hands-on practice to solidify your understanding! Let me know if you'd like any additional questions or if you need explanations for any of these.
